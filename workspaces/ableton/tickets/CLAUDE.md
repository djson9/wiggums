This file contains tickets / user stories that need to be resolved.


Example of what a ticket should look like.

example:
Date: TODAY'S DATE
Title: Dummy Ticket
STATUS: [COMPLETED | NOT COMPLETED]
Dependencies: Depends on the other ticket, for a reason.
Description: User should be able to perform user desired action. We should verify that it works after implementing. << ALWAYS VERIFY AFTER IMPLEMENTING
Comments:

DATE AND TIME: Did x, y, z actions and was 80% successful and 20% failed cases. << ALWAYS INCLUDE FAILED CASES

Add new tickets to this directory, with the filename format.
[EPOCH SECONDS]\_[Title].md
1769879447_Title.md

^^ Any tickets we pick up without this filename, we should update to standardize.
